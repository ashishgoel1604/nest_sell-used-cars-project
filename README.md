This Project is done to understand amd practice nestjs.

This project implemented as a SellUsedCar project.

In this a USER can get/calculate estimate pricing for his used car on basis of parameters liks -> year, company, mileage etc.

Also, after getting estimation and then Selling his car, USER can also add a REPORT for the Sale he made. These reports are assumed to be helping the further/future calculation of other cars. [Kind of Analytics]

The Report submitted can also be fake as well. So, for that case, the Report before publishing, has to be Approved by ADMIN user

This project is trying to impelement API for the above requirements.

As per the requirements, we have 2 main resources/entities ->
USER,
REPORTS

So our api's will revolve around these entities.

For more, Please refer to the code...
